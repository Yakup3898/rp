	  1) To store multiple values in a reserved area in memory, we may use "Array"s
	  2) An array can have just a single data type. You cannot put different data types in an array
	  3) When you create an array you have to declare a)Data types of the elements
	                                                  b) The number of elements
	  4)What kind of data types can we store in an array?
	  a)All primitives can be stored
	  b)Non-primitive ones CANNOT be stored in arrays.
	  c)Reference(Address) of non-primitive ones can be stored. 
	  So an array can only work with stack memory, not with heap memory. 
	  5) Arrays themselves are objects so they are stored in Heap Memory, arrays have methods in heap memory
	  next to the values
